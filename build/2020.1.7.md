the definition of a transaction is clear and simple , fit to be a beginning foundation for a software of complexity. 

```javascript
let transation = function(input: {lock:string,unlock:string}[],
	 output: {lock:string,val:string}[]){
		return {in: input, out: output}
}
```



to store some transactions , we need 

1. pool to store transactions that has been verified, transaction defination

```javascript
{
	input: {lock:string,unlock:string}[],
	output: {lock:string,val:string}[],
	No:string
}
```

2. UTXO_cur to store usable outputs to be stored in UTXO

```javascript
{
	lock:string,
	val:string
}
```

3. STXO to store used outputs to be deleted from UTXO

```javascript
{
	lock:string,
}
```

4. UTXO_his to store UTXOs as parts of history

```javascript
{
	lock:string,
	val:string
}
```
